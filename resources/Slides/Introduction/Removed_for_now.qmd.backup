## Access from VSCode

An **IDE** (Integrated Development Environment) is an interface from which you can edit files, use the terminal, write code. You might now IDEs such as Rstudio (very dedicated to R and python) and jupyterlab (for basically any language).

&nbsp;

A good recommendation to interact with the cluster is the IDE [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It has a very practical interface and many plugins that can make your life very easy once you get confident with it.

[Download VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and open it. Go to the plugin tab (red circle)

Search for `remote development`. Open the plugin (red circle) and install

When done, click on the remote symbol on the bottom-left corner (red circle),

choose `Connect current window to host` then `Add new SSH host`, and type:
```{.bash}
ssh username@login.genome.au.dk
```

If asked, select the file `.ssh/config`

After some waiting for the first installation, you are **logged in**, and can do it again whenever you open VScode.

Click on the browser tab (red circle), then `Open Folder` and choose your home by typing `/home/username`. You will see everything in your home in the browser on the left

It can be useful to have other folders at hand, such as projects.

Go to `File`--> `Add folder to workspace` and type a path of the type

```
/home/username/project
```

to see the project folder listed in the browser. You should see something like

Also, why not having a terminal as well, without jumping beteeen windows all the time? We still need it to run jobs, create environments and so on. 

&nbsp;

On the top menu, go to `Terminal` --> `New Terminal` (it might ask which is the current folder, if you added folders to the workspace).

&nbsp;

Note that the terminal is also logged into GenomeDK
