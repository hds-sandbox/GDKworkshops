# Background on workflows

## Workflow terminology

```{mermaid}

  A --->|samples.txt| B(["End"])
```

&nbsp;

:::{.callout-note title="Workflow and W. Management System"}
A **workflow** is a series of calculations and data manipulations which have to be performed in a specific sequence. 

&nbsp;

A **workflow management system** organizes the workflow steps through defined dependencies, can assign different computing resources to each step, 
keeps a log of the workflow, interacts with a cluster's queueing system. 
:::

---

```{mermaid}
%%| fig-width: 10
flowchart LR
  A0(["Start"]) --->|data.txt<br>INPUT| A[Rename<br>TARGET]
  A --->|samples.txt<br>OUTPUT| B(["End"]);
```

&nbsp;

- A **TARGET** is a specific step in a workflow

- Each target has a **SPECIFICATION** which describes what to do with the input files to produce the output files

- The specification is usually a **command line** which can be executed in a terminal

- Each target has **INPUTS** and **OUTPUTS** file(s)

---

```{mermaid}
%%| fig-width: 10
flowchart LR
  A0(["Start"]) --->|data.txt<br>INPUT| A[Rename<br>TARGET]
  A --->|samples.txt<br>OUTPUT-INPUT| B[GZip<br>TARGET]
  B --->|samples.txt.gz<br>OUTPUT| C(["End"]);

```

&nbsp;

- A target can be **dependent** on other targets, i.e. it needs their output files as input before it can run

---

```{mermaid}
%%| fig-width: 10
flowchart LR
  A0(["Start"]) --->|data.txt<br>INPUT| A[Rename<br>TARGET<br>cores=4<br>memory=24g<br>walltime=00:01:00]
  A --->|samples.txt<br>OUTPUT-INPUT| B[GZip<br>TARGET<br>cores=1<br>memory=8g<br>walltime=00:10:00]
  B --->|samples.txt.gz<br>OUTPUT| C(["End"]);

```

&nbsp;

- A target has settings for **resources** 
  - cores
  - memory
  - walltime (format `dd-hr:mn:sc`)
  which are used to run the target on a cluster

---

Each target of the workflow 

&nbsp;

 - is **submitted** by the **workflow manager** to the queueing system
 - can be **monitored** with the workflow manager 
 - influences the **queueing time** Depending on requested resources

## Gwf workflow manager

A lightweight and easy to adopt workflow manager. It requires only some basic `Python` - you can learn it along the way starting from examples. Some features:

&nbsp;

- Developed at AU (Dan at GenomeDK) and used also at MOMA, AUH, ...
  - Easy to find support
- In python, no need for a workflow language
  - You can use all python functions to build your workflow!
- Easy to structure a workflow and check resource usage
  - Reusable templates
  - Very pedagogical
- Conda, Pixi, Container usage out-of-the-box

# Setup a small workflow

The whole workflow is written **in a python script**. You first state the `Workflow` object, usually like this:

&nbsp;


```{.python}
#import libraries
from gwf import *

#initiate a workflow object
gwf = Workflow( )
```

&nbsp;

:::{.callout-note title="Using project resources"}
Now you have an empty workflow, which will use the few free resources each user has available. Resources from a project you are part of can be created using instead 

```{.python}
gwf = Workflow( defaults={"account": "PROJECT_NAME"} )
```
:::

---

### Templates

Now we create generic templates which will be applied to the specific targets.

- Which are the inputs and outputs?
- Which are the resources?
- Which commands are executed?

:::{.callout-note}
`return` will provide all info about the template when applying it to a target.
:::

```{.python}
def renameFile(inputName, outputName):
    inputs  = [inputName]
    outputs = [outputName]
    options = {"cores": 1, "memory": "1g", "walltime": "00:01:00"}
    spec = f"""
        cp {inputName} {outputName}
    """
    return AnonymousTarget(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs, options=options, spec=spec)
```

---

```{.python}
def zipFile(inputName):
    inputs  = [inputName]
    outputs = [f"{inputName}.gz"]
    options = {"cores": 1, "memory": "4g", "walltime": "00:10:00"}
    spec = f"""
        gzip -k {inputName}
    """
    return AnonymousTarget(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs, options=options, spec=spec)
```

:::{.callout-note}
`return` will provide all info about the template when applying it to a target.
:::

&nbsp;

Let's look again at the corresponding workflow graph:

```{mermaid}
%%| fig-width: 10
flowchart LR
  A0(["Start"]) --->|data.txt<br>INPUT| A[Rename<br>TARGET<br>cores=4<br>memory=24g<br>walltime=00:10:00]
  A --->|samples.txt<br>OUTPUT-INPUT| B[Zip<br>TARGET<br>cores=1<br>memory=8g<br>walltime=00:01:00]
  B --->|samples.zip<br>OUTPUT| C(["End"]);

```
---

### Apply templates to targets

Using templates is easy with `gwf`. You can use the `target_from_template` method to create a target from a template.

```{.python scrollable="true"}
target_rename = gwf.target_from_template("target_rename", 
                                         renameFile(inputName="data.txt", 
                                                    outputName="samples.txt")
                                        )

target_gzip = gwf.target_from_template("target_gzip", 
                                         zipFile(inputName="samples.txt")
                                        )
```

:::{.callout-note}
Each target has an unique name so that you will be able to inspect the workflow and its status.
:::

# Exercise

A more complex workflow

---

We will run this workflow and add some new targets to it

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  A0(["Start"]) -->|"data.fq"| A["split"]
  A -->|part001.fq| B["table"]
  A -->|part002.fq| C["table"]
  A -->|part....fq| D["table"]
  A -->|part010.fq| E["table"]
  B -->|table001.tsv| F["merge"]
  C -->|table002.tsv| F
  D -->|table....tsv| F
  E -->|table010.tsv| F
  F -->|table.tsv| G(["End"]);

```

## Exercise I: workflow with conda environments

Prepare everything for the exercise: create a **new folder**, then download **data and workflow file**

```{.bash}
 mkdir -p myPipeline
 cd myPipeline

 wget https://github.com/hds-sandbox/GDKworkshops/raw/refs/heads/main/Examples/smallGwf/data.fq -O data.fq
 wget https://github.com/hds-sandbox/GDKworkshops/raw/refs/heads/main/Examples/smallGwf/workflow.py -O workflow.py
```

---

Create a conda environment for `seqkit` and one for the `gwf` workflow software. Download the `seqkit` container as well.

&nbsp;

```{.bash}
conda config --add channels gwforg
#conda env pipelineEnv for gwf
conda create -y -n pipelineEnv gwf=2.1.1
#add package for resource usage/check
conda install -y -n pipelineEnv -c micknudsen gwf-utilization
#conda env seqKitEnv for seqkit
conda create -y -n seqkitEnv seqkit
#Container download
singularity pull seqkit_2.10.0  https://depot.galaxyproject.org/singularity/seqkit:2.10.0--h9ee0642_0
```

&nbsp;

:::{.callout-tip}
If you get an error because packages cannot be found, you need to add some default channels as well. Run the commands below:

```{.bash}
conda config --add channels bioconda
conda config --add channels conda-forge
```
:::

---

Now look at the `status` of your workflow. You should recognize all the steps (*targets*). Those are marked `shouldrun`, because the outputs and/or inputs are not existent. Remember to activate the environment for `gwf`.

&nbsp;

```{.bash}
conda activate pipelineEnv

gwf -f workflow.py status
```

![](img/status0.png){fig-align="center" width=500px}

&nbsp;

:::{.callout-tip}
You do not need the option `-f workflow.py` if your workflow file has the name `workflow.py`, which is the default `gwf` looks for.
:::

---

Now, you might also want to look at how a specific *target* looks like when the workflow is built

```{.bash}
gwf info split
```

You will be able to see the actual inputs, outputs, and other targets it depends from/depending on it:

```{.python .scrollable  code-line-numbers="4-6|8-9|11-21|24|25-35"}
{
    "split": {
        "options": {
            "cores": 1,
            "memory": "4g",
            "walltime": "05:00:00"
        },
        "inputs": [
            "data.fq"
        ],
        "outputs": [
            "gwf_splitted/part001.fq",
            "gwf_splitted/part002.fq",
            "gwf_splitted/part003.fq",
            "gwf_splitted/part004.fq",
            "gwf_splitted/part005.fq",
            "gwf_splitted/part006.fq",
            "gwf_splitted/part007.fq",
            "gwf_splitted/part008.fq",
            "gwf_splitted/part009.fq",
            "gwf_splitted/part010.fq"
        ],
        "spec": "\n    seqkit split2 -O gwf_splitted --by-part 10 --by-part-prefix part data.fq\n    ",
        "dependencies": [],
        "dependents": [
            "table_6",
            "table_8",
            "table_3",
            "table_0",
            "table_1",
            "table_4",
            "table_5",
            "table_9",
            "table_7",
            "table_2"
        ]
    }
}
```

---

:::{.callout-tip}
Do you want to see the whole workflow in a text editor? Use the `less` viewer, 

```{.bash}
gwf info | less
```

or output into a text file:

```{.bash}
gwf info > workflow_explicit.txt
```
:::

&nbsp;

Now, you can run specific targets. Let's specify some names to test out our workflow. 

```{.bash}
gwf run split table_0
```

:::{.callout-tip}
You can run the entire workflow with `gwf run` when you are sure of your targets working correctly with the right resources.
:::

---

Check the status: the two turgets will be `submitted`, then `split` has to run first, and its *dependency* `table_0` will run when the file `part_001.fq` is generated! We use `watch` in front of the command to update its view every two seconds (Use `Ctrl+C` to exit from it).

```{.bash}
watch gwf status
```

&nbsp;

At some point, you will see the `running` status (for a few seconds) and `completed` status.

![](img/gwfCompleted.png){fig-align="center" width=500px}


**Exercise break**

---

:::{.callout-tip}
When the status of a target is `failed`, or you want to verify messages on the command line, you can visualize the standard output and standard error messages of your target with the commands below (example with the `split` target):

&nbsp;

```{.bash}
gwf logs split 
gwf logs -e split
```
:::

---

### Resize the workflow resources and add a step

How many resources did `split` and `table_0` use? Run the utilization command:

```{.bash}
gwf utilization
```

![](img/gwfUtilization.png){fig-align="center" width=1000px}

&nbsp;

The table shows we underutilized the resources. Now open `workflow.py` and change your resource usage for the `split` and `table_` steps. Then, run the target:

```{.bash}
gwf run table_1
```
&nbsp;

Check again resource usage when the status is `completed`. Did it get better?

**Exercise break**

---

## Exercise II: singularity in workflows{.scrollable}

Now, you will change the executor for the template `table`. Your task is to:

  - open the `workflow.py` file
  - below importing the `Conda` module (line 2), add a new line with 

    `from gwf.executors import Singularity`
  - Now, define a new executor. Below the line where you define `conda_env = Conda("seqkitEnv")`, use a similar syntax and write `sing = Singularity("seqkit_2.10.0")`, where you provide the container file as argument.
  - At the end of the `align` template, use the new executor `sing` instead of `conda_env`.

&nbsp;

Did you do it right? If yes, then you should be able to run the `combine` target:

```{.bash}
gwf run combine
```

and see its status become `completed` after some time. All output files should be created in your folder! If not, something is wrong. Ask for help, or [look at the solution file, if you prefer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hds-sandbox/GDKworkshops/refs/heads/main/Examples/smallGwf/workflow_container.py).

:::{.callout-note}
Because `combine` depends on all `table_` targets, it will submit all those targets as well, which need to run first.
:::

**Exercise break**

---

## Exercise III: Your own target!{.scrollable}

Ok, now we want to extend the workflow and do quality control on the `part_###.fq` files. 

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  A0(["Start"]) -->|data.fq| A["split"]
  A -->|part001.fq| B["table"]
  A -->|part002.fq| C["table"]
  A -->|part....fq| D["table"]
  A -->|part010.fq| E["table"]
  B -->|table001.tsv| F["merge"]
  C -->|table002.tsv| F
  D -->|table....tsv| F
  E -->|table010.tsv| F
  F -->|table.tsv| G(["End"])
  A -->|"part[001-010].fq"| H["qc"]
  H -->|multiqc_report.html| I(["End"])
```

---

You need to:

  - create a new conda environment called `qcEnv` where you install the two packages `fastqc multiqc=1.29`.
  - add a new executor called `qc_env` based on `Conda("qcEnv")`.
  - create a new target which starts with `def qc(data_folder)`
    - this will need all ten `gwf_splitted/part_###.fq` file as input files (you can copy the output file list of the `split` template, where you use a variable `{data_folder}` instead of the explicit folder name!)
    - as output you want a file called `["reports/multiqc_report.html"]` (default name for the generated report)
    - as bash commands you need:
      ```{.bash}
      mkdir -p reports
      fastqc -o reports gdk_splitted/*.fq
      multiqc -o reports reports/
      ```
    - remember to set the correct executor at the end of the template inside `return`
    - now you need to create one single target from the template, call it `qc`. You only need to give as input the name of the folder with the `fq` files

---

:::{.callout-tip}
Some useful tips when developing a workflow:
- Before running any targets, use `gwf info qc` to check dependencies.
- Copy previous similar templates and modify them where needed, instead of writing each template from scratch
:::

&nbsp;

When you are sure you are done, then use `gwf run qc`. Its `status` should be `completed` if it runs successfully.

&nbsp;

Ask for help, or [look at the solution file, if you prefere](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hds-sandbox/GDKworkshops/refs/heads/main/Examples/smallGwf/workflow_qc.py).

&nbsp;

**Exercise break**

---

:::{.callout-note}
Good practices:

 - do not make tiny and numerous targets, try to put together things which can run quickly
 - start testing one of many parallel elements of a workflow before running them all at once
    - determine resource usage (`gwf utilization` - needs a plugin, see earlier exercises)
    - then adjust your templates' resources accordingly
 - verify often your code is correct
    - `gwf info | less -S` to check dependencies
    - remember you are using python, check some of your code directly in it!
  - when done, you are reproducible if you share with your datasets:
    - container pull commands
    - conda environment(s) package list 
    - workflow files
