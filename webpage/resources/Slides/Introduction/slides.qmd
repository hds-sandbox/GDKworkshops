# GenomeDK's ABC

Learn your way around the basics of the `GenomeDK` cluster.

## Infrastructure

`GenomeDK` is a **High performance computing (HPC) cluster**, i.e. a set of interconnected computers (nodes). `GenomeDK` has:

- **computing nodes** used for running programs (~15000 cores, 16GPUs)
- **storage nodes** storing data in many hard drives (~23 PiB)
- a **network** making nodes talk to each other
- a **frontend** node from which you can send your programs to a node to be executed
- a **queueing system** called *slurm* to prioritize the users' program to be run

---

![A single node with CPU and RAM](./img/nodePhoto.png){fig-align="center"}

---

### CPUs and cores

- A **CPU** (Central Processing Unit) executes instructions from programs.

- A CPU has multiple **cores**, each core can execute instructions independently at the cost of reduced bandwidth

![](./img/cpucores.png){fig-align="center"}

## Access 

## Accessing a HPC{.smaller} 

Powershell (Windows) or Terminal (MacOS, Linux) are powerful tools to interact with a HPC cluster.

&nbsp;

![Terminal for MacOS and Linux. This is called powershell in Windows.](img/terminal.png){width=400px fig-align="center"}

&nbsp;

:::{.callout-note title="Interactive desktop"}
GenomeDK also has an interactive desktop interface at [desktop.genome.au.dk](https://desktop.genome.au.dk) which can be used to access the cluster through a web browser. More on that later.
:::

---

Terminals look old, but it gives you enormous flexibility through efficient commands and scripting possibilities.


![An old "Dumb Terminal" from the 1970s](img/DEC.png){width=800px fig-align="center"}

---

## Getting access to GenomeDK

- **Creating an account** happens through [this form](https://console.genome.au.dk/user-requests/create/) at genome.au.dk

    ![](img/account.png){width=600px fig-alig="center"}

---

- **Logging into GenomeDK** happens through the command ^[both in Linux/Mac terminal and Windows Powershell. Powershell might require `ssh.exe` instead of `ssh`]

    ```{.bash}
    [local]$  ssh USERNAME@login.genome.au.dk
    ```

- When first logged in, **setup the 2-factor authentication** by 
    - showing a QR-code with the command

        ```{.bash}
        [gdk]$  gdk-auth-show-qr
        ```
    - scanning it with your phone's Authenticator app ^[e.g. Microsoft Authenticator, Google Authenticator, ...].


## Access without password

It is nice to avoid writing the password at every access. If you are on the cluster, exit from it to go back to your local computer

```{.bash}
[gdk]$  exit
```

&nbsp;

Now we set up a public-key authentication. We generate a key pair (public and private):

```{.bash}
[local]$  ssh-keygen -t ed25519
```

Always press <kbd>Enter</kbd> and do not insert any password when asked. 

---

and create a folder on the cluster called `.ssh` to contain the public key

```{.bash}
[local]$  ssh USERNAME@login.genome.au.dk mkdir -p .ssh
```
&nbsp;

and finally send the public key to the cluster, into the file `authorized_keys`

::: {.panel-tabset}
## Linux/Mac

```{.bash}
[local]$  cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh USERNAME@login.genome.au.dk 'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys'
```

## Windows PowerShell

```{.powershell}
cat $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_ed25519.pub | ssh USERNAME@login.genome.au.dk 'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys'
```

:::

&nbsp;

After this, your local private key will be tested against GenomeDK's public key every time you log in, without you needing to write a password.

# File System (FS) on GenomeDK

- Directory structure
- Absolute and Relative Paths
- important folders
- navigate the FS on the command line

## How the FS is organized

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%" }

Folders and files follow a hierarchy

- `/` is the root folder of the filesystem - nothing is above that
- the FS is shared across all machines and available to all users 
- `home` and `faststorage` are two of the folders in the root
- projects are in `/faststorage/project` and **linked** to your home

:::

::: {.column width="40%"}

![](img/complexTree.png){fig-align="center" width=350px}

:::

::::

---


## Exercise: 

Log in: `ssh USERNAME@login.genome.au.dk`

:::{.callout-note}
Run a command = Type a command + Enter
:::

- Run `pwd`, You should see your home folder: `/home/USERNAME`
    - `/home/USERNAME` is an example of **path**.
    - `pwd` shows your current folder (WD, Working Directory)
    - you can write paths starting FROM the WD!

---

- Run `ls .` to show the content of your WD (the dot `.`)

- Run `mkdir -p GDKintro` to create a `GDKintro` folder

- Run `echo "hello" > ./GDKintro/file.txt` to write hello in a file

- Use `ls -lh ./GDKintro` to see if the text file is there with some info.

:::{.callout-tip title="Relative and absolute paths"}
- `/home/USERNAME` starts from the root `/`. It is an **absolute path**.
- `./GDKintro` starts from the WD. It is a **relative path**.
:::


---

Look at the File system tree and answer to the following questions:

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%" }
![](img/complexTree.png){width=300px}
:::
::: {.column width="60%" }
```{python}
#| echo: false
from jupyterquiz import display_quiz
#git_url='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hds-sandbox/GDKworkshops/webpage-quarto/resources/Slides/Introduction/questions/paths.json'
display_quiz("./questions/paths.json", shuffle_answers=True, question_alignment="left")
```
:::
::::
---

### Something more about your home

After log in, you will find yourself into your private **home folder**, denoted by `~` or equivalently `/home/username`. Your prompt will look like this:

&nbsp;

```{.bash}
[username@node ~] 
```
which follows the format **[username@node current_folder]**.

&nbsp;

:::{.callout-warning}
- Do not fill up your home folder with data. It has a **limited amount of storage** (a quota of 100GB).
- Your home folder is **private to you only**
:::

---

## Exercise cont'd

We now set the WD into `GDKintro` and remove all text files in it. Then we download a zipped `fastq` file, unzip it, and print a preview!


```{.bash}
cd GDKintro

rm *.txt

wget https://github.com/hartwigmedical/testdata/raw/master/100k_reads_hiseq/TESTX/TESTX_H7YRLADXX_S1_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz \
     -O ./data.fastq.gz

gunzip data.fastq.gz

head data.fastq 
```

---

### Some notes about the commands

- `rm *.txt` removes all files ending with `.txt`. The symbol `*` is a wildcard for the file name

  :::{.callout-warning title="Forever away"}
  There is no trash bin - **removed files are lost forever** - with no exception
  :::

- `head` prints the first lines of a text file

## Exercise: Read files

Useful utility 1: `less` file reader. `less` is perfect for exploring (big) text files: you can scroll with the arrows, and quit pressing `q`. Try

```{.bash}

less data.fastq

```

&nbsp;
The very first sequence you see should be

```
@HISEQ_HU01:89:H7YRLADXX:1:1101:1116:2123 1:N:0:ATCACG
TCTGTGTAAATTACCCAGCCTCACGTATTCCTTTAGAGCAATGCAAAACAGACTAGACAAAAGGCTTTTAAAAGTCTA

+
CCCFFFFFHHHHHJJJJJJJJJJJJHIJJJJJJJJJIJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJHIJGHJIJJIJJJJJHHHHHHH
FFFFFFFEDDEEEEDDDDDDDDD
```

---

:::{.callout-tip title="Challenge yourself" icon=false}
Search online `man less` (or with `less --help)` how to look for a specific word in a file with `less`. Then visualize the data with `less`, and try to find if there is any sequence of ten adjacent `N`s (which is, ten missing nucleotides). Then, answer the question below 

```{python}
#| echo: false
from jupyterquiz import display_quiz
#git_url='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hds-sandbox/GDKworkshops/webpage-quarto/resources/Slides/Introduction/questions/less.json'
display_quiz("./questions/less.json", shuffle_answers=True, question_alignment="center")
```
:::

## Exercise: Write files

Useful utility 2: `nano` text editor. It open, edits and saves text files. Very useful for changes on the fly.

- Try `nano data.fastq`. Change a base in the first sequence, 

- then press Ctrl+O to save (give it a new file name `newData.fastq` and press Enter)

- press Ctrl+X to exit. If you use `ls` you can see the new saved file.


# Project management

- What are **GDK projects** 
- how to **track the resource usage**, and 
- how to **organize a project**

## GDK projects

:::{.callout-note title="what is a project"}
Projects are contained in `/faststorage/project/` and linked in your home, and are simple folders with some perks:

- you have to **request their creation** to GDK administrators
- **access is limited** to you, and users you invite
- CPU, GPU, storage and backup usage are **registered** under the project for each user
- you can **keep track** of per-project and -user resource usage 
:::

---

:::{.callout-warning title="Common-sense in project creation"}
- Do not request a lot of different small project, but make larger/comprehensive ones
    - **No-go example**: 3 projects `bulkRNA_mouse`, `bulkRNA_human`, `bulkRNA_apes` with the same invited users
    - **Good example**: one project `bulkRNA_studies` with subfolders `bulkRNA_mouse`, `bulkRNA_human`, `bulkRNA_apes`.

- Why? **Projects cannot be deleted**, so they keep cumulating
:::

## Creation

Request a project (after login on GDK) with the command

```{.bash}
gdk-project-request -g <project_name>
```

&nbsp;

After GDK approval, a project folder with the desired name appears in `~` and `/faststorage/project`. You should be able to set the WD into that folder:

```{.bash}
cd <project_name>
```

or

```{.bash}
cd ~/<project_name>
```

---

### Users management

**Only the creator** (owner) can see the project folder. You (and only you) can add an user

```{.bash}
gdk-project-add-user -g <project name> -u <username>
```

&nbsp;

or remove it

```{.bash}
gdk-project-remove-user -g <project name> -u <username>
```

---

Users can also be promoted to have administrative rights in the project

```{.bash}
gdk-project-promote-user -g <project name> -u <username>
```

&nbsp;

or demoted from those rights

```{.bash}
gdk-project-demote-user -g <project name> -u <username>
```

---

### Accounting

You can see **globally**  monthly used resources of your projects with

```{.bash}
gdk-project-usage
```

&nbsp;

Example output:

```{.bash .code-overflow-scroll}
project               period  billing hours  storage (TB)  backup (TB)  storage files  backup files
HDSSandbox            2024-8          44.58          0.09         0.00           6024             0
HDSSandbox            2024-9          25.38          0.09         0.00           6025             0
ngssummer2024         2024-6           6.73          0.00         0.00              0             0
ngssummer2024         2024-7        7547.48          0.72         0.00          27479             0
```

---

More detailed usage: by users on a selected project
&nbsp;

You can see how many resources your projects are using with 

```{.bash}
gdk-project-usage -u -p <project-name>
```

&nbsp;

Example output:

```{.bash .code-overflow-scroll}
project               period  billing hours  storage (TB)  backup (TB)  storage files  backup files
ngssummer2024  sarasj             2024-7          77.98          0.02         0.00            528             0

```

---

:::{.callout-tip title="Accounting Tips"}
- You can pipe the accounting output into `grep` to isolate specific users and/or months:

```{.bash}
gdk-project-usage -u -p <project-name> | grep <username> | grep <period>
```

&nbsp;

- all the accounting outputs can be saved into a file, which you can later open for example as Excel sheet.

Example:
```{.bash}
gdk-project-usage > accountingGDK.csv
```
:::

---

:::{.callout-tip title="Private files or folders"}
You have a folder or a file into the project which you do not want to share: Use 

```{.bash}
chmod -R go-rwx <file or folder>
```

&nbsp;

which you can revert using

```{.bash}
chmod -R go+rwx <file or folder>
```

Note: you cannot authorize only specific users to access data -  **you can only operate on the project members' level**.
:::

## Folders management

Have a coherent folder structure - your future self sends manu thanks.

![Example of structure, which backs up raw data and analysis](img/structure.png){width=400px fig-align="center"}

---

If your project has many users, a good structure can be

![](img/multistructure.png){width=400px fig-align="center"}

---

:::{.callout-warning title="MUST-KNOWs for a GDK project" layout-align="center"}
- remove **unused intermediate files**
    - unused and forgotten object filling up storage
- backup **only the established truth** of your analysis
    - in other words the very initial data of your analysis, and the scripts
- **outputs of many files** should be removed or zipped together into one 
    - otherwise GDK indexes all of them: slow!!!

&nbsp;

**Backup cost >>> Storage cost >> Computation cost**
:::


# Software management

&nbsp;

- **No preinstalled software** on GenomeDK

- You install and manage your **software and its dependencies** inside virtual environments

## Virtual environments

Each project needs specific software versions dependent on each other for **reproducibility** - without interferring with other projects.

&nbsp;

:::{.callout-note title="Definition"}
A **virtual environment** keeps project-specific softwares and their dependencies separated 

&nbsp;

A **package manager** is a software that can retrieve, download, install, upgrade packages **easily and reliably**
:::

---

![How virtual envs work: packages at different versions are kept separated into folders, together with all system files needed to make them work.](./img/virtualenvs.png)

## Conda

&nbsp;

Conda is **both** a virtual environment and a package manager.

- easy to use and understand
- can handle quite big environments
- environments are easily shareable
- a [large archive](https://anaconda.org) (Anaconda) of packages
- active community of people archiving their packages on Anaconda

## Pixi

A newer virtual env and package manager

&nbsp;

- An upgrade of Conda in speed and stability
- Can install the same packages as conda

---

A package manager puts together the dependency trees of requested packages to find all compatible dependencies versions.

![Figure: A package's dependency tree with required versions on the edges](img/condatree.png){fig-align="center" width="800px"}

---

To install a specific package in your environment, search it on [anaconda.org](https://anaconda.org):

![Figure: search DeSeq2 for R](img/anaconda1.png){fig-align="center" width="800px"}

:::{.callout-note title="Channels"}

packages are archived in channels. `conda-forge` and `bioconda` include most of the packages for bioinformatics and data science.

`conda-forge` packages are often the most up-to-date.
:::

---

### Exercise - Pixi

First of all, we open the **desktop interface to GenomeDK** at [desktop.genome.au.dk](https://desktop.genome.au.dk). Choose the open frontend for the login.

The desktop session will be operative even if you close and reopen your browser afterwards!

![The terminal will work as if you logged into the frontend (The desktop is logged into the front-end node already). You can also use the browser!](img/desktop.png)


---

Open the terminal and run the command below to install `pixi`:

```{.bash}
curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | bash
```

After that, make the system recognize `pixi`

```{.bash}
echo PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.pixi/bin" >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'eval "$(pixi completion --shell bash)"'  >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

---

Change your WD with the one we created earlier, where we have the file `data.fastq`

```{.bash}
cd ~/GDKintro
```

Initiate a new pixi environment into the folder:

```{.bash}
pixi init --channel conda-forge --channel bioconda
```
This will also use conda-forge and bioconda as channels for package installation.

---

:::{.callout-note title="What are channels?"}
Channels are repositories where packages are stored. 

`conda-forge` and `bioconda` are two of the most used channels for bioinformatics and data science and contain virtually any package you may need.

Note that we specified channels in the order of priority: `conda-forge` has higher priority than `bioconda` when installing packages, so you will always search for a package first in `conda-forge` and then in `bioconda`.
:::

---

Use the file browser and open the `GDKintro` folder

![](img/gdkintroFolder.png){fig-align="center" width="800px"}

You can see some new files. `pixi.toml` contains info `pixi` will use to create your environment.

---

Open `pixi.toml` with the text editor, and make sure you have the two channels `conda-forge` and `bioconda` as you required with the `pixi init` command. You can always add more channels if you find out later that you need them for specific packages

![](img/pixitoml.png){fig-align="center" width="800px"}

---

Now get back to the terminal and install some packages. Your working directory MUST be the same where `pixi.toml` is located!

```{.bash}
pixi add rstudio-desktop jupyterlab r-ggplot2 r-dplyr pandas
```

&nbsp;

The terminal will look like this at the end

![](img/pixiInstalled.png){fig-align="center" width="800px"}


---

Now open the `pixi.toml` file. You should see all the installed packages with related information.

:::{.callout-tip}
You can share `pixi.toml` with a collaborator. This will need to run `pixi install` and will recreate the same environment!

Does your collaborator need a file `environment.yml` to recreate the environment? Run
```{.bash}
pixi project export conda-environment environment.yml
```
:::

---

**Exercise Cont'd**

Be sure your WD is in the folder `GDKintro`. Then run

```{.bash}
pixi project export conda-environment environment.yml
```

Open the file `environment.yml`. It looks very similar to `pixi.toml` and is compatible with conda to recreate your environment. 

Let's zip those files into one:

```{.bash}
zip environment.zip pixi.toml environment.yml
```

# Data transfer

Data can be downloaded/uploaded in two ways:

- from the command line of a local computer

- using an interactive interface (Filezilla)


## Exercise cont'd - Download on shell

How to download the environment files to our computer? Open a terminal **on your computer** and run this command:

```{.bash}
scp USERNAME@login.genome.au.dk:/home/USERNAME/GDKintro/environment.zip .
```

`scp` needs your login and the **absolute path** to the file. We give also the download destination as the WD on the local computer (`.`)

:::{.callout-tip}
You can also upload a file switching the order of origin and destination in `scp`. E.g. 
```{.bash}
scp ./myFile.txt USERNAME@login.genome.au.dk:/home/USERNAME/GDKintro/myFile.txt 
```
:::

---

### Exercise - Download interactively

You can transfer data with an interactive software, such as `Filezilla`, which  has an easy interface. [Download Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client).

&nbsp;

When done, open `Filezilla` and use the following information on the login bar:

- Host: `login.genome.au.dk`
- Username, Password: your `GenomeDK` username and password
- Port: `22`

---

Press on `Quick Connect`. As a result, you will establish a secure connection to `GenomeDK`. On the left-side browser you can see your local folders and files. On the right-side, the folders and files on `GenomeDK` starting from your `home`.

![](./img/filezilla1.png){fig-align="center"}

---

**Download** the `environment.zip` file. You need to right-click on it and choose `Download`

![](./img/filezilla3.png){fig-align="center"}

You can do exactly the same to upload files from your local computer!


# Running a Job

&nbsp;

Running programs on a computing cluster happens through **jobs**. 

&nbsp;

Learn how to get hold of **computing resources** to run your programs.

## What is a job on a HPC

A computational task **executed on requested HPC resources** (computing nodes), which are handled by the **queueing system** (SLURM).

![](img/Job-on-cluster.png){fig-align="center"}

---


The command `gnodes` will tell you if there is heavy usage across the computing nodes

![Usage of computing nodes. Each node has a name (e.g. cn-1001). The symbols for each node mean running a program (`0`), assigned to an user (`_`) and available (`.`)](./img/gnodes.png)

If you want to venture more into checking the queueing status, Moi has done [a great interactive script](https://github.com/MoiColl/cluster_status) in R Shiny for that.

---

Front-end nodes are limited in memory and power, and **should only be for basic operations** such as

- starting a new project

- small folders and files management

- small software installations

- data transfer

and in general you **should not** use them to run computations. This might slow down all other users on the front-end.

---

## Interactive jobs

Useful to run a **non-repetitive task interactively**

Examples: 

- splitting by chromosome that one `bam` file you just got 

- open Rstudio and Jupyterlab

- compress/decompress multiple files, maybe in parallel

Once you exit from the job, anything running into it will stop.

---

### Exercise: Interactive job

You can also run an interactive job on GenomeDK desktop. Go back to it and use the terminal to go into the `GDKintro` folder:

```{.bash}
cd ~/GDKintro
```

Now run an interactive job. Use 8g of RAM, 2 cores, and choose 01:00:00 hours. Choose the `account` using the name of one of your projects, or delete it if you do not have projects.

```{.bash}
srun --mem=8g -c 2 --time=01:00:00  --account=PROJECT_NAME --pty /bin/bash
```

---

You will have to wait in queue. When you get the resources, the node in use is **shown in the prompt**. Below, for example, the node is `s21n32`.

```
[USERNAME@s21n32 ~]$
``` 

Now, run `rstudio` or `jupyterlab` (your choice!) from the `pixi` environment:
