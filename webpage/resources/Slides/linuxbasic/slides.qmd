- a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**, such as your point-and-click operating system
- a **Command Line Interface (CLI) or terminal**, where commands are interpreted and translated into actions

- Linux and Mac already have a terminal application

- For Windows, you can use 
    - WSL (windows Subsystem for Linux), which integrates a Linux virtual machine in Windows
    - One of many terminal softwares such as
        - gitbash
        - MobaXterm 

## Bash CLI on GenomeDK 

When logging in on GenomeDK from the terminal, you are presented with the cluster's CLI.



From this, you can access files and software using the bash language.
