# GenomeDK Computing Cluster Workshops

Welcome to the GenomeDK Computing Cluster Workshops! This repository contains materials and resources for participants to get started with utilizing the GenomeDK computing cluster efficiently. To access the material, [refer to the webpage of this repository](https://hds-sandbox.github.io/GDKworkshops)

The workshops slides you can find in the webpage cover the following topics:

## Introduction

The GenomeDK computing cluster is a powerful resource provided for computational genomics and bioinformatics research. This workshop aims to introduce participants to the **cluster infrastructure and access**, management of **packages and projects**, leveraging resources to run **computational jobs**, **downloading and exchanging** of data.

## Pipelines with gwf

In this workshop you will learn how to master GWF, the Genome Workflow Framework! GWF helps to easily **streamlining your bioinformatics pipelines** with efficiency and scalability. You will learn how to **create, customize, and manage pipelines** in a way that is tailored to your specific analysis. This workshop is for beginners but it can easily get quite advanced once the pipelines are beyond basic. A basic knowledge of `python` will help in understanding the fundamental blocks of the pipelines. A knowledge of `R`, which has a similar syntax, can help as well, though the language to be used for writing the pipelines is exclusively `python`.
